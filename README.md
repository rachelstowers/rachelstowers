- 👋 Hi, I’m @rachelstowers, a recent social science graduate with a strong interest in data analysis and community wellbeing.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis using Microsoft Excel, ArcMap, QGIS, and R, SQL, and Python programming. I am also interested in web design/development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on expanding my skills in data analysis and programming (R, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects related to community wellbeing, social equity, and place-based studies.
